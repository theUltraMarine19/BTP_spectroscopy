For running, use only the main functions
main - needed in case of face images
main_fly - running dictionary learning on the fly
main_fly_poisson - running dictionary learning on the fly with poisson noise
main_GMM - running offline and on the fly MAP EM algorithm
main_spectral - doing spectral separation
main_super - running dictionary learning for super-resolution

test, test_fast, test_fast_poisson - filling in missing pixels for reconstruction of only patches sampled randomly
spectral_sep - code for inferring dictionary in the case of spectral separation
data* - these files are used for assembling the image into a column of patches
compute* - files are used for dictionary learning
image_creator files are for constructing artificial images and images from minerals
